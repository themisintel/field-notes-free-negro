# Field Notes of a Free Negro

> A living archive of Black forensic memory and strategic resistance.

This public repository documents the empirical, emotional, and administrative fieldwork of **Christel Lautel** and **Themis Research & Systems Intelligence™**. It includes:

- 📜 **Field Receipts** — Tangible proof of institutional gaslighting, document forgery, and bureaucratic misbehavior.
- 🔍 **Administrative Forensics** — Metadata audits, timestamp mismatches, and cross-platform log analysis.
- 🧠 **Strategic Research Logs** — Epistemic reflections, AI collaborations, and operational case notes from the frontlines of cognitive warfare.

## 🧾 Origin

This repository was built in response to ongoing systemic suppression, institutional opacity, and the need for a **transparent, public ledger of state and school misconduct**—both analog and digital.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- GitHub (obviously)
- PDF metadata analyzers
- AI-assisted logging (ChatGPT + custom Luna protocols)
