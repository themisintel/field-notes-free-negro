## 1. Postcolonial Syndrome

The unresolved trauma and entitlement from having once ruled, extracted, and consumed without accountability.

- Rooted in loss of unchallenged dominance  
- Creates **neurotic mimicry** (desire to consume what it cannot authentically produce)  
- Projects fragility as virtue and dominance as benevolence  

**→ Breeds entitlement to cultural space without reciprocal responsibility.**

---

## 2. Epistemic Narcissism

The belief that white perception is *objectivity*, and everything else is *bias*.

- Assumes universality while discrediting *non-white knowing*  
- Refuses external feedback unless it confirms existing power  
- Positions discomfort as oppression  

**→ Undermines alternative realities by declaring them “unrealistic.”**

---

## 3. Cultural Mimicry & Consumption

The parasitic aesthetic obsession with Blackness *without* the burden of Black reality.

- “Borrow the rhythm, bury the history”  
- Turns cultural trauma into marketable content  
- Rewards proximity to Blackness *when white-curated*  

**→ Normalizes theft while resisting structural transformation.**

---

## 4. Strategic Avoidance + Strategic Inertia

Performative gestures with built-in exit ramps.

- DEI with no budget or power  
- “Listening” tours with no follow-up  
- Allyship declared, not demonstrated  

**→ Keeps systems intact by burning out the change agents.**

---

## 5. Privileged Myopia

The default white lens that sees comfort as fairness and discomfort as injustice.

- Equates inconvenience with oppression  
- Refuses to see systemic patterns unless personally affected  
- Needs repeated proof of lived Black reality to even consider its legitimacy  

**→ Blocks empathy, disrupts feedback loops, and disables growth.**

---

## 6. THE PERCEPTION GAP

A delusional, institutionalized chasm between white self-image and Black lived experience.

- Allies in name, extractors in practice  
- Surveillance mistaken for inclusion  
- Tokenism mistaken for presence  

**→ Produces the 81% vs 26% allyship stat that’s got you rightfully fuming.**
